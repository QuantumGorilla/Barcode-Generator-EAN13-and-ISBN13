Installation:
-------------

Barbecue comes with a pre-compiled war file in the distribution that you can drop straight
into a servlet compatible application server (e.g. Tomcat).

The Barbecue servlet is configured to be available from the following URL by default:

http://host:port/barbecue/

Any requests with this prefix will be routed to the Barbecue servlet.



Usage:
------

The recommended way to use Barbecue as a servlet is to reference it as the src for an
img tag. For example:

<img src="http://localhost:8080/barbecue/barcode?data=123545&height=50"/>



Notes:
------

If you are running the servlet on a headless server (i.e. one with no monitor or graphics
environment) then you must ensure that you use the servlet headless parameter, and also
set the following JVM property:

-Djava.awt.headless=true
